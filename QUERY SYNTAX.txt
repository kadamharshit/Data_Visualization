SQL (STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE) - MANAGE THE RELATIONAL DATABASES
5 TYPES OF SQL:

DDL (DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE)
CREATE: CREATE A TABLE/DATABASE/TRIGGER WITH CONSTRAINTS
ALTER: MODIFY OR ADD COLUMN
DROP: REMOVE THE TABLE/STRUCTURE.
TRUNCATE: REMOVE ALL THE ROWS BUT STRUCTURE IS KEPT AS IT IS.
RENAME: CHANGE THE TABLE NAME OR COLUMN NAME

DML (DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE)
INSERT: ADDING DATA IN ROW
UPDATE: MODIFY THE DATA IN ROW (EXISIING DATA)
DELETE: DELETE THE SPECIFIC ROW (BASED ON CONDITION HERE WHERE CLAUSE IS USED.)

DQL (DATA QUERY LANGUAGE
SELECT: RETRIEVE THE DATA 

DCL (DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE)
GRANT: PROVIDE PREVIELGE/PERMISSION TO DATABASE.
REVOKE: WITHDRAW THE PERMISSION FROM THE USER ON DATABASE.

TCL (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE)
COMMIT: PERMANTELY SAVE THE DATA
ROLLBACK: REVERSE ALL THE CHANGED IN THE CURRENT TRANSACTION.
SAVEPOINT: CREATE THE MARKER IN CURRENT TRANSACTION WHICH CAN BE ROLLBACK TO THE PREVIOUS CHANGES.



SQL SERVER COMMANDS:

EXISITING DATBASES=>
Show databases;

CREATE A DATABASE=>
create database database_name;

DROP DATABASE=>
drop database database_name;

ENTER A DATABASE=>
use database_name;

SEE TABLES IN THE DATABASE=>
show tables;

CREATE TABLE=>
create table table_name (column_name datatype constraint);

DESCRIPTION OF TABLE =>
desc table_name;

SELECT QUERY=>
NORMAL QUERY =>
select column_name /* (for all) from table_name;

SELECT WITH WHERE =>
select column_name /* (for all) from table_name where condition;



TRUNCATE QUERY:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

pattern matching
LIKE keyword:
select column_name from table_name where column_name like 'c%';

INSERT QUERY:

INSERT EACH ROW INDIVIDUALLY=>
insert into table_name values (values);

INSERT MUTIPLE ROWS IN ON GO=> (ALSO USED WHEN WE DONT KNOW SOME FIELDS VALUE)
insert into table_name (column_names) values (values);


USE DEFAULT KEYWORD WHILE INSERTING:
insert into table_name values (values,DEFAULT);



ALTER QUERIES =>

MODIFY COLUMN (USE FOR DATA TYPE MODIFICATION AND CONSTRAINTS ADDITION):
alter table table_name modify column column_name datatype contraints;

ADD COLUMN:
alter table table_name add column column_name datatype contraints;

RENAME COLUMN NAME (NO NEED TO MENTION DATA TYPE):
alter table table_name rename column old_column_name to new_column_name;

CONSTRAINT: UNIQUE =>
alter table table_name add column column_name datatype unique;

CONSTRAINT : CHECK=>
alter table table_name add column column_name datatype check(condition);

CONSTRAINT : NOT NULL =>
alter table table_name modify column column_name datatype not null;

CONTRAINT: DEFAULT =>
alter table table_name add column column_name datatype DEFAULT 'Value';



UPDATE QUERIES =>

Update table_name set coumn_name = value where column_name = value;



PRIMAY KEY => it is unique and used to other connect with other tables
syntax:
column_name datatype primary key

FOREIGN KEY => used to connect to other table
syntax:
table 1 => s_id int primary key,
table 2 => s_id int 
in table 2, foreign key (table_2 column name) references table1 name (table1 column_name);



JOINS => USED TO VIEW COLUMNS COMBINED FROM MULTIPLE TABLES.
IT IS FOR DML COMMAND - SELECT ONLY
TYPES:
Inner Join -> intersection of 2 tables
Left Join -> whole table 1
Right Join -> whole table 2
Full outer join -> combined table 1 and 2


INNER JOIN 
SYNTAX:
select table1.column_name,table1.column_name,table2.column_name,table2.column_name,
	from table1
	inner join table2
	on table1.column_name = table2.column_name
LEFT JOIN
SYTNAX:
select table1.column_name,table1.column_name,table2.column_name,table2.column_name,
	from table1
	left join table2
	on table1.column_name = table2.column_name

RIGHT JOIN
SYNTAX:
select table1.column_name,table1.column_name,table2.column_name,table2.column_name,
	from table1
	right join table2
	on table1.column_name = table2.column_name

FULL OUTER JOIN
SYNTAX:
SELECT table1.column_name, table2.column_name
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


ORDER BY CLAUSE (show the details in ascending or desending order)
syntax:
Select * from table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC/DESC;
Select * from table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC/DESC LIMIT 2; (this will show the data as per the limit here only 2 records)


mysql> alter table studDetails modify column gender char(1) check in(gender('m','f'));





WEBINAR SESSION:
AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

COUNT: select count(*) as alias_name from table_name ; => use alias(petname) in
AVG:  select avg(column_name) as alias_name from table_name;
SUM: select sum(column_name) as alias_name from table_name;
MAX: select max(column_name) as alias_name from table_name;
MIN: select min(column-name) as alias_name from table_name;
IN
LIKE

GROUP BY:

HAVING CLAUSE:

select first_name
from patients
group by first_name 
having count(*) = 1;



Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6 characters long:
select patient_id,first_name
from patients
where first_name like 's____%s'; 

Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending.
select distinct year(birth_date) as birth_year
from patients
order by birth_date asc;






Show patient_id, first_name, last_name from patients whos diagnosis is 'Dementia'.

Primary diagnosis is stored in the admissions table.
select patients.patient_id,first_name,last_name
from patients join admissions
on admissions.patient_id = patients.patient_id
where admissions.diagnosis = 'Dementia';
